# Guestbook

website comments section. like the good old days

using github issues to allow anyone to commit was inspired by [matt's minesweeper](https://github.com/mtfn/mtfn)

## Development

```shell
$ npm run dev
http://localhost:8080/
```

The Github Action builds and deploys the site whenever someone submits a guestbook comment.
